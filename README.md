# 🧠 AI for Student Well-being

This project uses *Machine Learning* to analyze student data and classify individuals into different well-being risk categories.  
The goal is to help schools and organizations identify at-risk students early for timely intervention and support.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Developed a *classification model* to assess student well-being based on behavioral and academic data.
- Worked on a dataset of 800+ student records.
- Achieved *89% accuracy* in predicting student well-being levels.
- Focused on *early detection* and *policy support* for improving student mental health.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- *Python*
- *Pandas, NumPy*
- *Scikit-learn*
- *Matplotlib, Seaborn*
- *Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab*

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy: 89%  
- Improved model robustness by 12% through refined feature engineering.  
- Helped identify key factors affecting student well-being (attendance, stress levels, performance, etc.).

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Data preprocessing and cleaning for real-world data.  
- Model evaluation and optimization.  
- Understanding ethical and responsible AI in education.

## 📁 Files Included
- studentwellbeingbyraa.ipynb — Main notebook with code and analysis.  
- README.md — Project description and overview.
